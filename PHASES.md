# PHASES — ClipFarm build plan

The ClipFarm build order from `clipfarm-spec.md` is executed as discrete phases. **One phase at a time.** Stop after each for manual verification by Lillian. Each phase's plan is written here *before* execution; once verified, the entry moves to `COMPLETED_PHASES.md` with assumptions captured.

Phase numbering matches the spec's build order (steps 0–11).

## Workflow rules

1. **Plan before executing** non-trivial phases. Write the plan into the phase entry below: scope, files touched, assumptions, what's deferred, how to verify.
2. **Stop after each phase.** Wait for Lillian to verify before starting the next.
3. **Document assumptions in `COMPLETED_PHASES.md`** when moving an entry over — not just what was built, but what was assumed where the spec was ambiguous.
4. **Trivial phases still get moved** to `COMPLETED_PHASES.md` (even without a written plan) so the audit trail is complete.
5. **Each completed phase will be reviewed** by both a self-assessment in this session and a separate Claude code-review session. `COMPLETED_PHASES.md` is the artifact those reviews read.

## Phase 7b — Script TOC view (primary assembly workflow)

*Promoted to v0 — see spec build order. To be planned before execution. Reuses Phase 7's `build_take_grid` data, different layout.*

## Phase 8 — Premade attempts generation

*To be planned before execution.*

**Advance notes** (carry into the plan when written):
- Two buckets: `premade_bucket="best"` (3–5 ship-worthy) and `premade_bucket="diagnostic"` (browse-only). UI surfaces them separately.
- Compute and store `continuity_score` for each generated attempt; treat the stored value as a cache (recompute on edit, never trust blindly).
- **Advisory carry from Phase 7 review**: `untagged_clips` UI semantics — the counter includes clips from sources unrelated to the current project's focus. Worth either a tooltip ("across your full library") or a "scope to source(s)" filter on the Take Grid summary chips. Polish, not blocking.

## Phase 9 — Live preview

*To be planned before execution.*

**Advance notes** (carry into the plan when written):
- **Cross-source preview blind spot**: btc.0.4 dogfood is single-source, so the alternating-`<video>` swap won't hit its worst case (~100–300ms cross-source latency) during early dogfooding. First multi-source attempt is the real stress test for whether MSE needs to come sooner than Stage 2. Don't declare success on btc.0.4 alone.
- `internal_pause_max_sec` on `AttemptClip`: when set, the resolver expands one attempt-clip into multiple `(start, end)` sub-ranges (each interior gap > max collapses to `max`). The swap-on-`ended` trick handles them the same as separate clips. Document this in the resolver so Phase 11 export doesn't reimplement the rule.

## Phase 10 — Attempt editing

*To be planned before execution.*

**Advance notes** (carry into the plan when written):
- Frame-precise nudge (`Cmd+Alt = ±1 frame`) uses `Source.fps`. If `fps is None` for a source (ffprobe failed in Phase 2), fall back to 30 fps with a one-time UI warning per source. See spec → "Source fps detection."
- "Tighten internal pauses" toggle sets `AttemptClip.internal_pause_max_sec` to a sensible default (start with 0.5s). Single button, no slider — the full per-segment aggressiveness UI is v1.
- **Trim-clamp test now lands for real**: with real attempts existing, the Phase 4 `clamp_attempt_trims_for_clip()` stub gets its failing-then-passing test. Boundary correction that moves a clip's `start_sec` inward past an `Attempt.clips[i].trim_start_offset` must clamp the offset, not leave the attempt referencing impossible coordinates.

## Phase 11 — Export

*To be planned before execution.*
